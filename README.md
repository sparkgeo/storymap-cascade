# Story Map Cascade

The Story Map Cascade℠ app lets you combine narrative text with maps, images, and multimedia content in an engaging, full-screen scrolling experience. In a Cascade story, sections containing text and in-line media can be interspersed with "immersive" sections that fill the screen with your maps, 3D scenes, images, and videos. Cascade is ideal for making compelling, in-depth stories that are very easy for people to navigate.

## Introduction
A Cascade story can be created from [ArcGIS Online](http://arcgis.com), from the [Esri Story Maps website](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/) or from a [Portal for ArcGIS](http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/arcgisserver/extensions/portal-for-arcgis) deployment. The Cascade's data are stored in a Web Application Item.
This repository provides the application source code for developers who want to customize the application.

For more information about the application, including a gallery of examples and a step-by-step tutorial, please see the [Cascade page](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/en/app-list/cascade/) on the [Esri Story Maps website](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/).

## Instructions
First create your Cascade story in ArcGIS Online using the [step-by-step tutorial](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/en/app-list/cascade/tutorial/).
Once your story is ready, you have to find its ID in ArcGIS Online. The ID is a 32 character string that you will find in your web browser's address bar when you are viewing your story.

![Screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/994078/16124454/e26566ba-33a3-11e6-9be1-8af3f9f86113.png)

1. [Download the application](http://links.esri.com/storymaps/story_map_cascade_zip)
2. Deploy the application on your webserver. See [FAQ](#how-to-deploy-the-application-on-a-web-server) for details
3. Edit index.html, find the configuration section on line 47 and paste in your application ID
4. Navigate to index.html (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1/Cascade/index.html`)

Enjoy!
You can continue to use the builder in ArcGIS Online to modify your story.
See [customize the look and feel section](#customize-the-look-and-feel) or [developer guide](#developer-guide) if you want to modify the app.

*If you are using Portal for ArcGIS, please follow the instructions at the end of `app/config.js` to configure the application.*

## Maptiks integration

1. Add the Maptiks wrapper as a package alias in `main-config.js`:

    ```
    window.dojoConfig = {
        // ...
        aliases: [
            // ...
            ['maptiks', '//cdn.maptiks.com/esri3/mapWrapper.js']
        ]
    };
    ```
2. Story map applications provide [dojo/topics](https://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/1.9/dojo/topic.html) (global events), that we can subscribe to in order to monitor the application life cycle. We have added a custom topic, called "map-loaded" that fires when a web map loads. By listening to these events within `MainView.js`, we ensure that Maptiks monitors each map individually.

    Story map applications also provide helper functions, within the "app" global variable, which stores information about the app, including settings specified by the author within the application builder. Below, we use app variable to access Maptiks parameters entered by the author in the application builder. If the builder UI is unnecessary, these values may be hard-coded in development.

    See the [Developer guide](#developer-guide) for more information about topics and helper functions.
    
    Finally, require the Maptiks package and create the mapWrapper object, which will communicate with Maptiks using the trackcode associated with your domain and ID of your choice.

    ```
    topic.subscribe('map-loaded', function(response) {
      var sectionIndex = $(response.map.container).parents('.section').index('.section'); // get current section index
      var appSettings = app.data.appItem.data.values.settings;
      if (appSettings.maptiks) {
        require(['maptiks'], function(mapWrapper) {
          var container = $(response.map.container);
          var maptiksMapOptions = {
            maptiks_trackcode: appSettings.maptiks.trackcode, // trackcode entered in builder
            maptiks_id: appSettings.maptiks.id + ':section' + sectionIndex // ID entered in builder: current section
          };
          mapWrapper(container, maptiksMapOptions, response.map);
        });
      }
    });
    ```

## FAQ

For more answers, please see the [Story Map website FAQ page](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/en/faq/); it includes a section about [Cascade](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/en/faq/#category10).

### What are the supported browsers?
Cascade stories are supported on Internet Explorer 11 and above, Chrome, Firefox, Safari and the most recent tablet and smartphone devices.
Cascade authoring is only supported on Chrome and Safari on a desktop computer. We are working on supporting more browsers.

We actively test the application in all major browsers but if you experience difficulties, especially with the builder, we recommend that you use [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_us/chrome/browser/).

### Tips for your content

We have posted a number of tips and tricks for authoring your Cascade app [on the esri blog](https://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/tag/story-map-cascade/), as well as several ["How To Cascade" tutorials](https://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/2017/02/10/how-to-cascade/) using Cascade itself.

### Security

#### Can I keep my story private?
Yes, the regular ArcGIS Online security model applies.
By default your story is private, you can share it through Cascade builder or ArcGIS Online.
When you share your story through the Cascade builder, its maps and layers will also be shared if you own them or have privileges to share them. You will still need to make sure webscenes and embedded apps are accessible to your audience when you share, as they are not shared automatically with the story.

#### Can I use private webmaps or layers?
Yes.

When the story is hosted in ArcGIS Online or Portal for ArcGIS, users that don't have access to the story or a webmap used in the story will be redirected to the ArcGIS Online sign-in page. It is not possible to display an authentication dialog in the application when it's hosted in ArcGIS Online.

When the story is hosted on your web server, by default an authentication dialog will appear inside the application. But we recommend that you configure the application to use OAuth. OAuth 2.0 based authentication is available for ArcGIS Online and Portal for ArcGIS users with developer or organizational accounts. Follow [this procedure](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/share-maps/add-items.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_0D1B620254F745AE84F394289F8AF44B) to add and register an application to get an OAuth application ID. Once you have that application, open `index.html`, locate the `configOptions` section and fill the `oAuthAppId` property.

If you are using secured services but don't want users to have to authenticate, you can use a proxy to store the username/password to be used, see [Working with Proxy Services](https://developers.arcgis.com/authentication/working-with-proxies/#selfhosted-proxy-service), and add a proxy rules to specify what services need to use the proxy by editing `PROXY_RULES` in `app/config.js`.

### Deployment
Deploying a Cascade story requires use of ArcGIS Online or Portal for ArcGIS. The Cascade content must be created using the Cascade builder and will live in a Web Application Item.

#### Can I use the template without ArcGIS Online or Portal for ArcGIS?
This is not a supported use case at that time. Please let us know if you are interested by such a scenario.
Cascade relies heavily on the Portal for ArcGIS API but it is doable to modify the application to support other scenarios.

#### Where is the data stored?
The Cascade data are stored in a Web Application Item in ArcGIS Online or Portal for ArcGIS. This includes the narrative content, reference to any media used (webmaps, webscenes, pictures, audio, videos, web pages), and app-wide settings.

The images, audio, and videos that you include in your story using the builder are not copied in ArcGIS Online unless you upload them through the ArcGIS option. You have to make sure that those medias that are stored on other services are, and will remain, accessible to your audience.

#### Can I deploy Cascade on Portal for ArcGIS?
Yes, Cascade is included with Portal for ArcGIS starting at version 10.5.1.

#### Can I use the builder with the downloadable?
Yes, when the story is configured with an application ID, adding the URL parameter 'edit' will open the builder. You will be prompted for user authentication.

#### How do I deploy the application on a web server?
If you are not familiar with web servers, here are some solutions:
 * Use the web server that comes with your Operating System. On Windows, this is Internet Information Services (IIS); if you have a `C:\inetpub\wwwroot` folder on your computer, you should be able to access its content using `http://localhost`
 * On Windows or Mac OS, use a simple web server like [Mongoose](https://code.google.com/p/mongoose/) (not recommended for production)

If you are experiencing some rendering issues like improper symbols appearing instead of icons, you will have extra configuration to perform. Some servers require the configuration of a new mime type to be able to serve Cascade fonts correctly. See the following links for more information:

 * [IIS Mime types](http://codingstill.com/2013/01/set-mime-types-for-web-fonts-in-iis/)
 * [Properly serve webfonts](http://blog.symbolset.com/properly-serve-webfonts)

#### Can I use a single deployment of Cascade for multiple stories?
Yes.
If you have customized the application and deployed it on your server, you don't need to copy it multiple times, edit index.html and paste a different application ID for each story you want to publish.

Instead edit `index.html`, locate the `configOptions` section and fill the `authorizedOwners` property with the ArcGIS Online or Portal for ArcGIS login of the owner(s) of the story you want to use. This makes it possible for the application to display any of stories created by the specified user(s) through a URL parameter.

Example of the same application displaying two stories:
 * http://myserver.com/Cascade/index.html?appid=c7ad1a55de0247a68454a76f251225a4
 * http://myserver.com/Cascade/index.html?appid=c7ad1a55de0247a68454a76f251225a5

## Configuration
In addition to the configuration offered by the builder, the file `app/config.js` provides various additional settings. This is for example the place where you can override some settings like the list of Geocoder services to be used (changes override ArcGIS Online or your Organization default settings). See the documentation provided in that file for more details.

## Customize the look and feel

Cascade currently offers a light and dark theme and the option to choose between four different fonts. Other look and feel customizations can be done using the [regular application download](http://links.esri.com/storymaps/story_map_cascade_zip) and including the css/html overrides directly into `index.html`. A `style` tag is already present for you in `index.html` (search for `/* CUSTOM CSS RULES */`).

As the application Javascript and CSS are minified, **we don't recommend that you directely edit those files** (e.g. `viewer-min.css`, `viewer-min.js`, ...). In addition to being hard to edit, this will make application update complex for you.

If you want to change the behavior of one functionality or want to add new one, follow the [developer guide](#developer-guide) below.

The easiest way to find the ID or path of a DOM element that you want to customize is to use your browser's developer tools -- read the documentation for [Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/), [Safari](https://developer.apple.com/library/safari/documentation/AppleApplications/Conceptual/Safari_Developer_Guide/Introduction/Introduction.html), [Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools).

## Developer guide

This developer guide is intended for developers who want to modify the behavior of, or add new functionalities to, the Cascade application.
It requires knowledge of HTML, Javascript and CSS languages.

For more infomation about using and customizing Esri's Storytelling Apps follow the [Story Maps Developers' Corner](https://developerscorner.storymaps.arcgis.com).

### Application life cycle
Cascade fires events that allow customization with loose integration. This mean that you don't need to understand the application internals to implement simple extensions.

To try those events, look in the file `src/app/custom-scripts.js`.

```
require(['dojo/topic'], function(topic) {
  /*
   * Custom Javascript to be executed while the application is initializing goes here
   */

  // The application is ready
  topic.subscribe('tpl-ready', function() {
    /*
     * Custom Javascript to be executed when the application is ready goes here
     */

    // console.log('Cascade is ready');
  });

  /*
   * Custom Javascript to be executed when a section becomes active
   */
  topic.subscribe('story-navigated-section', function(/*cfg*/) {
     // console.log('The section', cfg.index, 'is now active');
  });

});
```

### Developer helpers
In addition to the events described above, the story data, configuration and useful helpers functions can be accessed through the global variable `app`.

```
console.log("Story title", app.Controller.getStoryTitle());
console.log("Sections objects", app.data.sections);
console.log("First section bookmark", app.data.sections[0].getBookmark());
console.log("First section text preview", app.data.sections[0].getPreviewText());
console.log("Sections display informations", app.display.sections);
console.log("Second section vertical position (px)", app.display.sections[1].top);
console.log("IDs of all the ArcGIS content in the story", app.Controller.getArcGISContent());
```

### Environment setup

Clone the repository or download a [copy of the repository as a zip file](https://github.com/Esri/story-map-cascade/archive/master.zip).

To build a production version of the application from the source code, you first need to install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).

Then initialize the environment by running the following commands **in the Cascade folder**:
 * `npm install`
 * `npm install –g grunt-cli`

This will create a new `node-modules` folder in your project root with all the tools required to build the application. If you have trouble running the second command, [see this documentation on how to install grunt-cli locally](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli#installing-grunt-cli-locally).

### How to use the application from the source code
 * Make accessible the Cascade folder on a web server. Use your favorite server or run one with `grunt server`; this will start a server on port `8080`
 * If using a Portal for ArcGIS instance, configure the `DEFAULT_SHARING_URL` property in `app/config.js` (close to the bottom of the file)
 * Run the following command: `grunt dev`
 * Navigate to index.html using the URL parameter `appid` to specify the web item to be loaded, e.g.: `http://localhost:8080/index.html?appid=ABCD` (configuring `index.html` > `configOptions.appid` is not supported in development mode)
 * If you want to use a non-public story or the builder you need to configure an `oAuth` ID in `index.html`. Follow [this procedure](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/share-maps/add-items.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_0D1B620254F745AE84F394289F8AF44B) to add and register an application to get an OAuth application ID. Once you have that application, open `index.html`, locate the `configOptions` section and fill the `oAuthAppId` property.

### How to build the application from the source code
  * Open a terminal and navigate to the Cascade folder
  * Run the following command: `grunt`

The deploy folder now contains the built application that you can [deploy to your web server](#instructions).

### Issues building the application

The build script performs code validation through [ESLint](http://eslint.org/). You can disable those validations by editing `Gruntfile.js` -- look for the following comments `/* Comment out to disable code linting */`.

### Design
Cascade relies on AMD and Dojo loader [AMD](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/3/jshelp/inside_dojo_amd.html) for its application structure. Most of the viewer uses ES2015, and some builder components use [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). The build chain is based on Grunt, r.js and Babel.

The application is structured as follows:

| Path          			                  	| Contains																						|
| ---------------------------------------------	|  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Gruntfile.js									| Build configuration																			|
| src/											| Main source code folder with index.html					|
| src/app/										| Javascript and CSS source code 																|
| src/app/config.js			            		| App configuration file (loaded at execution time) 											|
| src/app/storymaps/common/				| Modules common across storymaps templates (main module is Core.js)							|
| src/app/storymaps/common/builder/				| Builder modules (main module is Builder.js)													|
| src/app/storymaps/common/ui/					| UI components																					|
| src/app/storymaps/common/utils/				| Utils, sharing, some external libraries																			|
| src/app/storymaps/common/_resources			| Static resources																				|
| **src/app/storymaps/tpl/**					| Cascade modules (build configuration files in the root)									|
| src/app/storymaps/tpl/builder/				| Builder modules (main module is BuilderView.js)												|
| src/app/storymaps/tpl/core/					| Core modules (main module is MainView.js) 													|
| src/app/storymaps/tpl/view/						| UI components of the viewer and builder											|
| **src/app/storymaps/tpl/view/media/**						| Map, Scene, Image, Audio, Video, WebPage, Text											|
| **src/app/storymaps/tpl/view/section/**					| Cover, Sequence, Immersive and Title sections 										|
| **src/app/storymaps/tpl/view/ui/**						| Header										|
| src/app/storymaps/tpl/utils/						| Utils											|
| src/app/storymaps/issue-checker/ | Issue checking utility (finds errors in story) |
|src/lib/									| Dependencies (included in the final app)														|
| src/lib-build/								| Dependencies used by the build (not included in final app)									|
| src/resources/								| Static resources																				|


The main dependencies are:
 * [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
 * [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
 * [MediumEditor](https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor)

The application Javascript and CSS are minified into four files:

| File			        |										                                        |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| app/viewer-min.css	| Compressed CSS loaded when accessing the story as a viewer		        |
| app/viewer-min.js	    | Compressed Javascript loaded when accessing the story as a viewer	    |
| app/builder-min.css	| Compressed CSS loaded when accessing the story as an author		        |
| app/builder-min.js	| Compressed Javascript loaded when accessing the story as an author	    |

Depending on the URL parameters, index.html will load the corresponding files.
